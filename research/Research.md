## 1. Word Tab Stops vs. LaTeX Alignment

![https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/5802](blob:https://chatgpt.com/484279ec-b738-40be-bed7-fc69958a31e8)

Word (and OOXML) represents tab stops as absolute positions (in  *twips* , where 1 inch = 1440 twips) with specified alignment (left, right, center, decimal)[python-docx.readthedocs.io](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/analysis/features/text/tab-stops.html#:~:text=completely%2C%20acting%20as%20if%20it,at%20least%20one%20w%3Atab%20element). In Word, a tab character will jump to the next defined tab stop; for example, pressing Tab can push text to a right-aligned stop at a fixed position (often used for dates or numbers on the same line as left-aligned text). Simply converting a tab to `\hfill` in LaTeX often **misaligns content** because `\hfill` distributes space dynamically to fill the line, rather than moving to a specific fixed position. Key points and solutions include:

* **Twips to Length Conversion:** A converter should read the `<w:tab>` positions (e.g. `w:pos="4320"` for a 3-inch tab)[python-docx.readthedocs.io](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/analysis/features/text/tab-stops.html#:~:text=completely%2C%20acting%20as%20if%20it,at%20least%20one%20w%3Atab%20element) and convert that to an exact LaTeX length (in points/inches). This allows replicating the precise stop. For example, a right tab at 6.29 inches could be handled by moving to 6.29″ from the margin before placing text[github.com](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/5802#:~:text=%5Cvspace%7B%5Cbaselineskip%7D%20%5Csection,10pt%7D2).
* **LaTeX `tabto` Package:** The `tabto` package provides `\tabto{length}` to move to an absolute horizontal position. Using `\tabto{6.29in} Text` will place “Text” starting at 6.29 inches from the left margin. This is useful for *left-aligned* tab stops. For *right-aligned* stops, one can combine `\tabto` with a fixed-width box. For example: `\tabto{6.29in}\makebox[0pt][r]{2}` will position a right-aligned “2” such that its right edge sits at 6.29in.
* **LaTeX `tabbing` Environment:** The built-in `tabbing` environment can simulate typewriter-like tabs. One can declare tab stops with `\=` and use `\>` to jump to them. Notably, in `tabbing`, a back-to-back tab (e.g. `\>` with no text then another `\>`) will skip an empty tab field – analogous to consecutive Tabs in Word. This can naturally handle multiple tab stops (including empty intermediate columns) without producing multiple `\hfill` glues.
* **Using Tables for Alignment:** In cases with a known number of tab-separated fields (e.g. Left, Center, Right text on one line), a one-row `tabular*` or `tabularx` can be used. For example, a layout with left and right text can be done with:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="2367" data-end="2491"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\begin</span><span>{tabular*}{</span><span>\textwidth</span><span>}{@{</span><span>\extracolsep</span><span>{</span><span>\fill</span><span>}}l r@{}}
    Left text </span><span>&</span><span> Right text </span><span>\\</span><span>
  </span><span>\end</span><span>{tabular*}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  This uses stretchy space to push the right text to the margin. For three segments (left–center–right), one can use `l c r` with two `\fill` columns or simply `Left \hfill Center \hfill Right` in a line (LaTeX will distribute space so that “Center” comes roughly in the middle).
* **`\rightskip` Glue:** As an alternate low-level approach, LaTeX’s `\rightskip` can be set to a large flexible glue to push content to the right margin[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/511278/pandoc-how-to-allow-right-tab-stop-when-converting-a-docx-exported-from-google#:~:text=1). For instance, `{\rightskip=0pt plus 1fil Text}` will flush “Text” to the right. However, this applies to entire paragraphs; using it for individual tab alignment is tricky. It's usually clearer to use one of the structured approaches above.

**Recommendation:** Parse the DOCX tab stops and preserve their intent. If a tab stop aligns text at a specific position, prefer using a fixed-position command (`\tabto` or a tabbing stop) rather than a raw `\hfill`. This will ensure, for example, that a date intended at 6.5″ on the line actually appears exactly there in LaTeX, rather than just spaced out to the margin. In summary,  *map Word’s absolute tab stops to explicit LaTeX lengths or tabbing constructs for faithful alignment* . This approach was demonstrated in a Pandoc issue, where the correct solution was to use `\tabto{6.29in}` for a right-aligned number[github.com](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/5802#:~:text=%5Cvspace%7B%5Cbaselineskip%7D%20%5Csection,10pt%7D2).

## 2. Inconsistent Paragraph and Line Spacing

Word’s spacing model differs significantly from LaTeX’s default. Word paragraphs can have **Space Before/After (in points)** and a chosen **Line Spacing** mode (Single, 1.5 lines, Double, “Exactly X pt”, or “At least X pt”). LaTeX, by contrast, typically uses a constant baseline skip for line spacing and a generally fixed inter-paragraph skip unless manually adjusted. Key differences and mapping strategies:

* **Paragraph Spacing (Before/After):** In Word, a style might specify e.g. 12pt space after a paragraph. LaTeX’s equivalent concept is the vertical space between paragraphs. By default LaTeX classes have no extra `\parskip` (except in some like `\paragraph` style or lists). To mimic Word, the converter can insert `\vspace{...}` at the end of a paragraph or adjust `\parskip`. For a global approach, one can set `\setlength{\parskip}{12pt}` (or whatever value) to imitate Word’s paragraph spacing. If Word uses “Space Before”, a `\vspace` before the paragraph or a custom environment could be used. In cases where spacing is only for certain styles (e.g. more space before headings), it’s best to define a macro or use packages like `titlesec` to configure `\titlespacing` for those headings.
* **Line Spacing – “Single” vs Exact:** Microsoft Word’s “Single” spacing isn’t a fixed multiple of font size; Word has built-in extra padding. For a 12 pt font, Word Single might result in ~14 pt actual line height (about 1.15×)[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/65849/confusion-onehalfspacing-vs-spacing-vs-word-vs-the-world#:~:text=21)[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/65849/confusion-onehalfspacing-vs-spacing-vs-word-vs-the-world#:~:text=In%20Microsoft%20Word%2C). Word’s “1.5 lines” and “Double” are also larger than true 1.5× or 2× (Word’s 1.5 ≈ 1.75×, double ≈ 2.33× according to typographic sources[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/65849/confusion-onehalfspacing-vs-spacing-vs-word-vs-the-world#:~:text=In%20Microsoft%20Word%2C)). LaTeX, on the other hand, if you use the `setspace` package: `\onehalfspacing` is a true 1.5× (150%) line spacing. This means a direct conversion of “1.5 line” from Word should use a slightly larger factor in LaTeX if trying to exactly match Word’s appearance. As one source notes, to get ~135% line spacing (common optimal) Word requires ~1.15 multiple, whereas LaTeX would use 1.2 directly[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/65849/confusion-onehalfspacing-vs-spacing-vs-word-vs-the-world#:~:text=21).
* **LaTeX Line Spacing Control:** The recommended way is to use the `setspace` package. For example:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="6170" data-end="6301"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\usepackage</span><span>{setspace}  
  ...  
  </span><span>\setstretch</span><span>{1.15}  </span><span>% 1.15 "Multiple" line spacing, similar to Word's default  </span><span>
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  or `\onehalfspacing` for 1.5. Inside specific environments, one can use `\begin{spacing}{1.24} ... \end{spacing}` to apply a custom multiple. If Word’s style says “Exactly 18pt” for line spacing, one can set an explicit baseline skip: e.g., for a 12pt font, `\fontsize{12pt}{18pt}\selectfont` will lock lines at 18pt leading. (Alternatively, use `\linespread{1.5}\selectfont` – noting it multiplies the  *baseline* , so `\linespread` needs to be followed by `\selectfont` or set in the preamble.)
* **“At Least” vs “Exactly”:** Word’s “At least X” means the line spacing will be X or larger if needed (e.g., if there's a large inline math or image it will expand). LaTeX’s normal behavior is somewhat similar: if an inline object is taller than the baseline skip, TeX will naturally increase the line spacing  *for that line* . However, LaTeX doesn’t have an *exactly X* unless you use a strut or a fixed box. If one truly needs to mimic Word’s “Exactly” (which can clip content if too tall[medium.com](https://medium.com/@mattsamberg/line-spacing-explained-9aecda41f48d#:~:text=etc,text%20difficult%20to%20work%20with)), LaTeX would require setting a fixed `\baselineskip` and perhaps `\vskip` adjustments, but generally this level of fidelity isn’t needed for content (and clipping is not desirable). It’s usually safe to use the multiple line spacing approach.
* **Mapping Strategy:** The converter can detect Word’s settings via the `<w:spacing>` tag in the DOCX (e.g., `<w:spacing w:before="120" w:after="120" w:line="240" w:lineRule="auto"/>` where values are in twips)[docs.fileformat.com](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/#:~:text=%3Cw%3Ap%3E%20%3Cw%3ApPr%3E%20%3Cw%3ApStyle%3E%20w%3Aval,w%3Ar). This example indicates 6pt before/after (120 twips each) and line spacing “Multiple 1.0” (240 twips = 12pt, likely single). These should be translated to LaTeX as: `\parskip=6pt` (if consistent across the document or for that style) and default line spacing (which for 12pt font is ~14pt in LaTeX; minor difference). If Word had `w:lineRule="exact"` with a specific value, using a fixed baseline skip is appropriate.

In summary,  **Word’s paragraph spacing can be handled with `\parskip` or manual `\vspace`, and line spacing with the `setspace` package or explicit lengths** . By tuning these, one can closely match Word’s look. For example, to reproduce Word’s “1.5 lines” spacing, use `\onehalfspacing` (which gives true 1.5×). If needed, adjust slightly (e.g., 1.24×) to account for Word’s peculiarity[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/65849/confusion-onehalfspacing-vs-spacing-vs-word-vs-the-world#:~:text=In%20Microsoft%20Word%2C). The goal is to **preserve the relative spacing** (headings, lists, etc., should have similar spacing before/after as in Word). Careful use of lengths (LaTeX’s rubber lengths with plus/minus components) can also imitate Word’s flexible spacing, but a simpler approach is usually sufficient.

## 3. Header Styling Differences (Underlines, Shading, etc.)

Word often applies decorative styling to headings or titles: for example,  **colored background shading behind text** , or **underline rules** extending across the column width. LaTeX does not have an out-of-the-box equivalent in the standard sectioning commands, but it is very flexible through packages:

* **Underlines for Headings:** If a Word heading style has an underline (sometimes Word uses a bottom border on the paragraph to simulate this), one could mimic it with `\underline{Heading Text}`. However, plain `\underline` in LaTeX underlines only the text and breaks on descenders. A more robust solution is to draw a rule under the heading. The `ulem` package provides `\uline{...}` which underlines without breaking spaces (useful for multi-word headings). For a full-width rule (spanning beyond the text), one can use a combination of `\makebox` or `\rule`. For example:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="9939" data-end="10018"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\section</span><span>*{Title</span><span>\protect</span><span>\linebreak</span><span>[1]</span><span>\rule</span><span>{</span><span>\textwidth</span><span>}{0.4pt}}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  This will put a horizontal line under the title (0.4pt thick here). A more elegant way is via `titlesec` (see below).
* **Background Color (Shading):** LaTeX’s `xcolor` package lets us use `\colorbox{color}{text}` to put a colored rectangle behind `text`. For instance, to replicate a Word heading with, say, blue background and white text, one could do: `\colorbox{blue}{\textcolor{white}{\textbf{Heading 1}}}`. This can be wrapped in a custom command for reuse. Another approach is to use TikZ to draw a rectangle spanning the text width. For example, one can draw a filled rectangle at the baseline of the heading text, or use TikZ’s `\node[fill=blue] {Heading 1};` with proper sizing.
* **The `titlesec` Package:** For a configurable “style layer” approach, `titlesec` is highly recommended[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430168/underline-and-background-color-for-section-or-subsection#:~:text=)[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430168/underline-and-background-color-for-section-or-subsection#:~:text=%5Cusepackage). It allows redefining the format of \section, \subsection, etc., with pretty much arbitrary code. For example, to put a colored box behind the section title text and an underline, one could do:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="11123" data-end="11344"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\usepackage</span><span>{titlesec,xcolor}
  </span><span>\titleformat</span><span>{</span><span>\section</span><span>}[block]</span><span>%</span><span>
    {</span><span>\Large</span><span>\bfseries</span><span>\filright</span><span>}{}{0em}</span><span>%</span><span>
    {</span><span>\colorbox</span><span>{yellow!50}{</span><span>\parbox</span><span>{</span><span>\dimexpr</span><span>\textwidth</span><span>-2</span><span>\fboxsep</span><span>}{</span><span>#1</span><span>}}</span><span>\\</span><span>[-2pt]</span><span>\rule</span><span>{</span><span>\textwidth</span><span>}{0.5pt}}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  This is an illustrative example where the section title (#1) is placed inside a yellow box spanning the text width, then a rule is drawn right below it[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430168/underline-and-background-color-for-section-or-subsection#:~:text=%5Cusepackage%5Bexplicit%5D). The `titlesec` approach keeps style definitions separate from content, much like Word’s style definitions. One can adjust colors, box padding (`\fboxsep`), etc., in one place.
* **TikZ for Fancy Decorations:** In extreme cases (e.g., Word has a gradient or some shape), TikZ can be used to draw behind the heading text. For instance, using TikZ to draw a line or shape at a certain y-offset from the title. This is more complex but very powerful for custom corporate styles.
* **Underline vs. Rule:** If Word’s header style uses an underline that only extends under the text (not margin to margin), the simplest LaTeX equivalent is `\uline{Heading Text}` (from ulem). If it extends the full width of the column, treat it as a decorative rule (as shown above with `\rule{\textwidth}{...}`).

**Recommendation:** Use `titlesec` to create a style file that defines how headings should look, separate from the content. For example, map “Heading 1” style to a custom LaTeX format that perhaps uses a `\colorbox` for background or an underline rule. This way, all headings automatically get the desired effect. This approach is analogous to Word’s style templates. By doing so, the converter can output simply `\section{Heading Text}` and the styling is applied via the preamble definitions, making the LaTeX *editable* and style-configurable. For example, one could define in the preamble a command `\newcommand{\HeadingOneFormat}[1]{\colorbox{gray!30}{\textbf{#1}}\par\nointerlineskip\mbox{}\hrulefill}` and then have converted text use `{\HeadingOneFormat{My Title}}`. This separates content from styling, much like Word. In summary, **leverage LaTeX packages (titlesec, xcolor, ulem, TikZ) to reproduce Word’s header aesthetics** in a maintainable way[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430168/underline-and-background-color-for-section-or-subsection#:~:text=%5Cusepackage)[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430168/underline-and-background-color-for-section-or-subsection#:~:text=%5Cusepackage%5Bexplicit%5D).

## 4. Font and Typography Fidelity

One major difference between Word output and a naive LaTeX conversion is the  **font** . Word documents often use fonts like Times New Roman, Calibri, Arial, etc., and apply kerning and hinting that give a certain appearance. By default, LaTeX (pdfLaTeX) uses Computer Modern, which immediately makes a converted document look different. To get closer fidelity:

* **Use XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX with `fontspec`:** These engines allow direct use of system fonts (TrueType/OpenType). The converter should generate a preamble that uses the same fonts as the Word document for main text, headings, etc. For example, if the Word doc uses *Calibri* for body text, include:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="14071" data-end="14135"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\usepackage</span><span>{fontspec}
  </span><span>\setmainfont</span><span>{Calibri}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  If bold/italic variants are needed, fontspec will pick them up automatically (assuming the font is installed). Similarly, `\setsansfont` and `\setmonofont` can be used if the document had multiple families. Using the real font greatly improves fidelity of metrics and appearance – the text will break and paginate more like the Word version.
* **Font Sizes and Margins:** Ensure that LaTeX uses the same base font size (e.g., 11pt or 12pt) as the Word doc. The converter might set `\documentclass[12pt]{article}` if Word’s Normal style was 12pt. Matching page margins (via the `geometry` package) is also important for overall layout.
* **Microtypography (`microtype` package):** PDFTeX and LuaTeX support micro-typographic enhancements: font expansion and character protrusion. The `microtype` package should be included for polished output. It adjusts character spacing slightly to improve justification and allows punctuation to hang slightly into margins[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/microtype?tab=Frequent#:~:text=,character%20protrusion%20and%20font%20expansion). Word has its own justification algorithms, and while not identical, microtype helps LaTeX produce fewer hyphens and more even spacing, closer to what Word might achieve. It also enables margin kerning that can resemble Word’s optical adjustments. In short, *microtype makes LaTeX output look more professional and closer to Word’s refined layout*[tex.stackexchange.com](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/microtype?tab=Frequent#:~:text=,character%20protrusion%20and%20font%20expansion).
* **Font Rendering and Hints:** Even with the same font, LaTeX’s rendering might appear slightly different (Word does some font smoothing, etc.). Using modern engines ensures we use the actual TrueType outlines, and the output PDF will be high-quality. If the goal is an editable LaTeX, the visual fidelity may not need to be pixel-perfect, but using the same font family is crucial for line breaks to match.
* **Ligatures and Special Characters:** Word often uses ligatures (e.g., “fi” combined) depending on font. LaTeX with fontspec will also use ligatures by default. If, for some reason, fidelity needs turning off ligatures (to exactly match text), the converter could insert `\DisableLigatures` (from microtype) or use the `[Ligatures=TeX]` fontspec option for certain fonts. Generally, this is not necessary unless comparing text metrics.
* **Math Fonts:** If the Word doc contains equations (Word’s Equation Editor or MathType), achieving fidelity is much harder – Word uses Cambria Math by default. In LaTeX, one could use `unicode-math` with `\setmathfont{Cambria Math}` to use the same math font under Xe/LuaLaTeX. This is an advanced step but worth noting for completeness in a pipeline aiming for fidelity in mathematical content.

In summary, to minimize the “it looks different from Word” issue,  **set LaTeX to use the same fonts and appropriate packages** . For example, a Word doc in Times New Roman 12pt can be converted to LaTeX using `\usepackage{newtxtext}` (Times clone for pdfLaTeX) or simply `\setmainfont{Times New Roman}` with XeLaTeX, and the output will closely resemble the original. Combining that with `microtype` for fine adjustments will produce a result that is not only visually closer but typographically superior (LaTeX with microtype is known to handle justification very well). This addresses complaints about font differences and spacing in conversion.

## 5. Multiple `\hfill` from Adjacent Tabs

If the converter naively replaces every Word tab character with `\hfill`, issues arise when there are  **multiple tabs in sequence** . For example, consider a line in Word with three columns of text separated by two tab stops (Left, Middle, Right). In Word, you might hit Tab twice to skip the middle if it's blank, etc. A naive conversion might output:

<pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="17851" data-end="17899"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>First part </span><span>\hfill</span><span></span><span>\hfill</span><span> Last part
</span></span></code></div></div></pre>

This is problematic – in LaTeX, `X \hfill \hfill Y` collapses into  *two infinite glues* , effectively pushing `Y` to the right and `X` to the left, but the extra `\hfill` can also insert excessive space or even cause the line to overfull (the two fills together share the space, often leaving none between if one is redundant).

 **Correct Approach for Multiple Tabs:**

* **Combine consecutive tabs** : The conversion logic should detect when multiple tab characters occur with no intervening text. Two consecutive tabs usually mean an empty column in Word. Instead of outputting two `\hfill`, treat it as one larger separation or an empty group. For instance, `\hfill` (with no text) followed by another `\hfill` is effectively the same as a single `\hfill` (the first fill will consume all space leaving none for the second). Thus, two in a row is redundant. Remove or collapse them.
* **Interpret tab stops globally:** Ideally, parse the entire line of text and split it by tabs into segments. Then you know how many segments (columns) there are. You can then decide: if two segments -> use one `\hfill`; if three segments -> use two `\hfill` in between segments. For more than three segments, multiple fills or a structured approach (like a tabular) is needed. This way, you’ll never output adjacent `\hfill` without text between.
* **Use a structured environment:** As discussed in section 1, using `tabularx` or `tabbing` can naturally handle multiple tab stops. In a `tabularx` with columns `X X X` (stretchy columns), an empty middle cell will still occupy space (or collapse if using `@{\hskip}` for separation). The `tabbing` environment’s behavior is that a double tab `\>\>` will indeed skip a tab stop (leaving that field empty)[ctan.math.illinois.edu](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/tabto/tabto-doc.pdf#:~:text=,fit%20well%20in%20the%20remaining). So, a converter could emit a `tabbing` environment line like:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="19748" data-end="19842"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\begin</span><span>{tabbing}
  First part </span><span>\></span><span> Middle part </span><span>\></span><span> Last part </span><span>\\</span><span>
  </span><span>\end</span><span>{tabbing}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  If *Middle part* is empty, it would be equivalent to `First part \> \> Last part`, which `tabbing` handles by advancing two stops (one empty). This avoids any misalignment or weird glue issues, at the cost of a more complex output structure.
* **Example:** Suppose a Word line has: **Name:** `<tab>` **Title:** `<tab>` **Date:** `<tab>`  **2025** . This has multiple tabs (maybe to align Title in center and Date on right). A smart LaTeX output would be something like:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="20317" data-end="20400"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\textbf</span><span>{Name:} </span><span>\hfill</span><span></span><span>\textbf</span><span>{Title:} </span><span>\hfill</span><span></span><span>\textbf</span><span>{Date:} 2025
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  (assuming the last field is right-aligned date, with preceding label). In contrast, a bad output would be `Name: \hfill \hfill Date: 2025` if Title was empty – this would result in too much space. The improved parsing ensures we don’t insert `\hfill` unless there is a corresponding segment of text to separate.

**Recommendation:** Implement a  **tab-collapse algorithm** : scan for runs of tab characters and reduce them. Possibly treat a series of tabs as indicators of empty columns. The goal is to prevent LaTeX from seeing multiple glue commands in a row which can produce unpredictable spacing. Instead, use the appropriate number of fills or fixed spaces for the intended alignment. As a rule of thumb,  *never output `\hfill\hfill` with nothing in between* . Either one of them is unnecessary or they should be replaced by a different construct (for center alignment, for example, one might use `\hfill{}{\hfill` around a center piece). If center alignment is needed (text centered between margins with left and right content on sides), consider using a combination like: `Left \hfill Center \hfill Right`. But if *Center* is empty, this simplifies to `Left \hfill Right`, which is the proper form. Thus, the converter should simplify the sequence.

 By merging consecutive tab stops and handling multi-segment lines in one go, the LaTeX output becomes cleaner and avoids odd spacing artifacts. This makes the resulting `.tex` both easier to edit and more semantically faithful to the original layout intent.

## 6. Fragmented Bold/Italic Text Runs (Style Coalescing)

Word’s internal representation breaks text into **runs** (`<w:r>`) each with its own properties (`<w:rPr>` for bold, italic, etc.). In many cases, Word will split a single visually continuous bold text into multiple runs – for example, if there’s a change in some hidden property or just due to how editing occurred. A retrospective analysis likely found that the converter was outputting things like `\textbf{Hel}\textbf{lo}` instead of a single `\textbf{Hello}`. This fragmentation makes the LaTeX harder to read and edit (and can even affect kerning or line breaks). To address this:

* **Understand Word Runs:** Each `<w:r>` contains text (`<w:t>`) and can have properties like bold (`<w:b/>`), italics, underline, color, etc. Word might create separate runs for each word or portion, even if all share the same styling. For example, the XML might look like:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="22843" data-end="22958"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-xml"><span><span><w:r</span><span>></span><span><w:rPr</span><span>></span><span><w:b</span><span>/></span><span></w:rPr</span><span>></span><span><w:t</span><span>>Bold </span><span></w:t</span><span>></span><span></w:r</span><span>>
  </span><span><w:r</span><span>></span><span><w:rPr</span><span>></span><span><w:b</span><span>/></span><span></w:rPr</span><span>></span><span><w:t</span><span>>text</span><span></w:t</span><span>></span><span></w:r</span><span>>
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  Both runs are bold (w:b)[cnblogs.com](https://www.cnblogs.com/maoyuwei/p/11637738.html#:~:text=,%3Cw%3Ab%2F%3E%20%3C%2Fw%3ArPr%3E%20%3Cw%3At%3E%E4%B8%80%E3%80%81%3C%2Fw%3At)[cnblogs.com](https://www.cnblogs.com/maoyuwei/p/11637738.html#:~:text=%3C%2Fw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3ArPr%3E%20%3Cw%3ArFonts%20w%3Ahint%3D,%3C%2Fw%3At%3E%20%3C%2Fw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3ArPr), but they were split perhaps by editing. A converter that processes runs sequentially would output **two** bold commands. We should merge them.
* **Coalescing Algorithm:** The solution is to **post-process the run list** for each paragraph. Traverse runs and merge consecutive ones that have the same effective formatting. “Effective formatting” means after considering style inheritance – but in practice, you can assume runs explicitly marked bold/italic similarly can be merged. Pseudocode:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="23562" data-end="23947"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-pseudo"><span>currentStyle = None
  bufferText = ""
  for each run in paragraph:
      style = (isBold=run.bold, isItalic=run.italic, ... etc)
      if style == currentStyle:
           bufferText += run.text
      else:
           flush bufferText to output with currentStyle
           currentStyle = style
           bufferText = run.text
  endfor
  flush remaining bufferText
  </span></code></div></div></pre>

  After this, you will output a single `\textbf{...}` for the combined text. For instance, the two runs above become one `\textbf{Bold text}` in LaTeX.
* **Merging Adjacent Styles:** If runs share *all* the same style attributes, they can be merged safely. Be cautious: if there are differences (e.g., one run has bold+italic, the next has only bold), you cannot merge without altering formatting. Similarly, runs might differ in less obvious ways (one might start a hyperlink, or have a different font or color). The algorithm should consider only merging when the *entire set* of styling properties is identical. In practice, Bold/Italic are the most common; others like underlines or color should also be respected.
* **Hyperlink/Field Boundaries:** Word often splits runs around field codes or hyperlinks. For example, part of a bold phrase might be hyperlinked, causing three runs: bold, bold+hyperlink, bold (again). Merging across a hyperlink boundary is not correct if it removes the hyperlink. So the coalescing logic should also break on runs that have different *non-formatting* properties (like hyperlink targets). Essentially, only merge runs that are purely stylistic duplicates.
* **Result in LaTeX:** The benefit is cleaner output. Instead of `{\bfseries Text}{\bfseries continued}`, you get one contiguous `{\bfseries Text continued}`. LaTeX itself doesn’t mind either way, but for editing and reading the .tex, it’s much nicer. Also, certain LaTeX optimizations (like kerning, hyphenation) work better within a single group than across separate ones. For italics, in particular, merging prevents issues like an italic correction inserted between fragments.
* **Example:** In the DOCX XML snippet below, the Chinese text “一、 解答题” is bold but split into three runs (perhaps around the space)[cnblogs.com](https://www.cnblogs.com/maoyuwei/p/11637738.html#:~:text=,%3Cw%3Ab%2F%3E%20%3C%2Fw%3ArPr%3E%20%3Cw%3At%3E%E4%B8%80%E3%80%81%3C%2Fw%3At)[cnblogs.com](https://www.cnblogs.com/maoyuwei/p/11637738.html#:~:text=%3C%2Fw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3ArPr%3E%20%3Cw%3ArFonts%20w%3Ahint%3D,%3C%2Fw%3At%3E%20%3C%2Fw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3Ar%3E%20%3Cw%3ArPr). A coalescing algorithm would join these and output simply `\textbf{一、 解答题}` instead of `\textbf{一、}\textbf{ }\textbf{解答题}`. This not only preserves the meaning but yields a single bold section in LaTeX.

**Recommendation:** Incorporate a run-merging step in the conversion pipeline. Libraries like `python-docx` or others give access to runs and their properties, making it straightforward to compare and concatenate texts. This significantly improves the *editability* of the generated LaTeX. It aligns with the principle that the converter should not inject needless complexity. By reducing the fragmentation of bold/italic text, the resulting `.tex` is closer to what a human would write. (No one manually writes `\textbf{He}\textbf{llo}` when they mean `\textbf{Hello}` – the converter shouldn’t either.) This coalescing has been identified as a key improvement to avoid “messy” LaTeX output.

## 7. True Multi-Column Layout Detection and Conversion

Word supports multi-column sections (like a newsletter format with 2 or 3 columns). In the DOCX, a multi-column layout is indicated in the section properties: `<w:sectPr>` contains a `<w:cols>` element. For example, `<w:cols w:num="2" w:sep="1" w:space="425"/>` means  **2 columns** , with a vertical separator line (`w:sep="1"`) and 425 twips spacing between columns[cnblogs.com](https://www.cnblogs.com/maoyuwei/p/11637738.html#:~:text=%3Cw%3AsectPr%20w%3ArsidR%3D,425). A robust converter should detect this and translate it into an equivalent LaTeX construct:

* **Detecting Columns in DOCX:** The presence of `w:num="2"` (or more) in `w:cols` is the clue. If `w:num` is absent, one should also check for multiple `<w:col>` child elements which sometimes explicitly list each column’s width. Typically, if `w:num="2"`, it’s two columns of equal width by default (with `w:space` defining the gutter). This could correspond to LaTeX’s `twocolumn` layout or the `multicol` environment.
* **Using the `multicol` Package:** The `multicol` package provides a convenient environment for multi-column text within a single document[overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Multiple_columns#:~:text=Two,starting%20with%20this%20basic%20example)[overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Multiple_columns#:~:text=%5Cusepackage). It allows you to break into columns and then revert to single column easily. For instance:

  <pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="28057" data-end="28163"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\begin</span><span>{multicols}{2}
  ... (text that should flow in two columns) ...
  </span><span>\end</span><span>{multicols}
  </span></span></code></div></div></pre>

  This will typeset the content in two balanced columns on each page (until the environment ends). The converter can insert `\begin{multicols}{2}` at the start of the multi-column section (detected from Word) and `\end{multicols}` where the section ends (Word indicates end of section usually with another sectPr for the next section, possibly going back to 1 column).
* **Page-wide vs Section-wide:** If the entire document from start to finish is two-column, one could use the LaTeX `\twocolumn` option in the document class. However, Word allows mixing one and multi-column sections. So `multicols` is more flexible for localized multi-column text. It also by default balances the text at the end of the section (so columns end on the same height)[overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Multiple_columns#:~:text=Unbalanced%20columns), which Word also does unless specified otherwise. If balancing is not desired (Word has an option to not balance columns), `multicols*` environment can be used for unbalanced columns[overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Multiple_columns#:~:text=Unbalanced%20columns).
* **Column Breaks:** Word might have “column break” characters (similar to page breaks but for columns). In LaTeX, within a `multicols` environment, one can force a column break with `\columnbreak`. The converter should map any manual column breaks accordingly.
* **Alternative – `paracol` Package:** `paracol` is another package that allows more complex multi-column arrangements, including asynchronous columns (where content in one column doesn’t just flow from the previous). If the Word document has something like parallel columns that are not linked (sometimes used for bilingual texts or side-by-side comparisons), `paracol` might be appropriate. However, most common Word usage is continuous flow columns, which `multicol` handles well. `paracol` could be overkill unless specific parallel content needs to be preserved exactly.
* **Margins and Gutter:** Ensure that the LaTeX column width and separation matches Word’s. For two columns, LaTeX `multicols` by default makes equal-width columns that fill the text area, with a default `\columnsep`. You can adjust `\setlength{\columnsep}{<value>}` to match Word’s `w:space` (which is the gap *between* columns in twips). For example, `w:space="425"` twips ≈ 425/20 = 21.25 pt ≈ 0.3 in. Setting `\columnsep=0.3in` would replicate that spacing.
* **Floating Objects:** One caveat: Word allows images/tables spanning columns or within columns. LaTeX’s multicols has limitations with floats (they don’t work well inside the environment). A possible advanced approach: if a figure or table in Word is set to span the full page width, the converter might need to insert a `\end{multicols}` before it, then place the figure, then `\begin{multicols}{2}` again. This is complex but might be needed for fidelity. Alternatively, use the `dblfloat` environments or `\begin{figure*}` in two-column mode. This is a detailed implementation point depending on requirements.

**Recommendation:** *Implement multi-column support by wrapping content in a `multicols` environment.* For each DOCX section, if `w:cols` indicates more than one column, emit something like:

<pre class="overflow-visible! px-0!" data-start="31318" data-end="31401"><div class="contain-inline-size rounded-2xl corner-superellipse/1.1 relative bg-token-sidebar-surface-primary"><div class="@w-xl/main:top-9 sticky top-[calc(--spacing(9)+var(--header-height))]"><div class="absolute end-0 bottom-0 flex h-9 items-center pe-2"><div class="bg-token-bg-elevated-secondary text-token-text-secondary flex items-center gap-4 rounded-sm px-2 font-sans text-xs"></div></div></div><div class="overflow-y-auto p-4" dir="ltr"><code class="whitespace-pre! language-latex"><span><span>\begin</span><span>{multicols}{N}
... content of that section ...
</span><span>\end</span><span>{multicols}
</span></span></code></div></div></pre>

Ensure that any section break back to a single column is handled by ending the environment. This will preserve the intended layout. Users can then edit the LaTeX with full knowledge that within those environments, the text flows in columns. Also, mention in documentation that the `multicol` package is used, so they need to compile with it. If fidelity demands are high, also print a comment about any assumptions (e.g., “%% Two-column layout from Word section break”). This approach was not done by some simpler converters (Pandoc, for example, doesn’t automatically do columns), but adding it dramatically improves fidelity for documents that use multi-column formats.
