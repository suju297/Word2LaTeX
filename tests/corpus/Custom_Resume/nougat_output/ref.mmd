**EXPERIENCE**

**Software Engineer Intern (Co-op)**

Jan 2025 - Aug 2025

**Xellar Biosystems**

_Boston_

* **Architectected and optimized a FastAPI microservice with Redis-backed caching to convert and persist 16-bit images on first load, enabling a median response time of < 0.4 s for repeat requests**
* **Automated high-throughput S3 ingestion using boto3 with concurrent upload orchestration, retry logic, and conflict resolution policy (overwrite, rename, skip) for terabyte-scale datasets**
* **Standardized raw microscopy data into a canonical S3 structure and auto-generated a per-file manifest used by the FastAPI service for Redis lookups and reliable retrieval**

**Graduate Research Assistant - AI-CARING**

Feb 2024 - Aug 2025

**Northeastern University - Khoury College of Computer Sciences**

_Boston_

_MA_

* **Deployed a multi-stage pipeline that extracts reminder intent from caregiver conversations and compiles it into AST-validated Python functions**
* **Designed a feasibility checker using the OpenAI o4 mini reasoning model that validates reminders against available sensors and a home layout graph before generation, preventing non-feasible reminders**
* **Orchestrated a low-latency AWS IoT Core to gRPC middleware streaming data from over 120 sensors (about 3,000 events per second) and achieved a 50% reduction in end-to-end latency**

**Senior Software Engineer**

Feb 2022 - Aug 2023

**Cappemini**

_India_

* **Engineered a Python/Flask inference gateway for multimodal AI workloads, integrating model endpoints and optimizing request handling for 40% lower response latency**
* **Scaled inference workloads on Kubernetes with autoscaling and monitoring to ensure 99.9% uptime**

**Software Engineer**

**2022**

**UTIMindtree**

_Mumbai_

_India_

* **Integrated 30+ REST/SOA APIs in Node.js with async patterns and MongoDB caching, improving performance by 15% and cutting API calls by 30%**

_Implemented graceful shutdowns and monitoring to reduce recovery time by 50% and maintain 99.9% uptime_

**ACADEMIC PROJECTS**

**Time-Series Forecasting with Market Indicators (TSLA)**

Sep 2024 - Dec 2024

* Built a macro-finance dataset and developed a time-series ML pipeline using OLS, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving R2 = 0.88 and 50% lower RMSE vs baseline models**
* **Applied PCA and K-Means/GMM clustering with a backtesting system to evaluate trading signals (945 trades, 57% win rate) and validate model stability across regimes**

**Quant Stack Exchange Chat Assistant**

Sep 2024 - Oct 2024

* Developed FinRobot, a generative AI chat assistant for quantitative finance using AutoGen with RAG, delivering context-aware answers with approximately 85% response accuracy
* Engineered a scalable knowledge layer with a daily Python scraping pipeline that ingests Quant Stack Exchange into Neo4j (knowledge graph) and **Pinecone (vector index) to enable fast, entity-aware retrieval**
